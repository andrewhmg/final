<h1>Welcome to the World of Absurdism!</h1>

<p>Absurdism is a philosophical concept which states that the universe is inherently irrational and meaningless. It is based on the idea that human existence is ultimately pointless and no matter what we do, our lives will ultimately end in death and nothingness. In this way, absurdism is closely related to nihilism, which is the belief that life is without objective meaning or purpose.</p>

<p>This idea was first popularized by the French philosopher Albert Camus in his book, The Myth of Sisyphus. In it, he argued that life is ultimately meaningless, and the only way to make sense of it is to embrace the absurdity of it all and accept that nothing can be done to change the fact that life is pointless.</p>
